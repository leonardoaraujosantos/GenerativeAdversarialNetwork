    "### By [Jon Bruner](https://github.com/jonbruner) and [Adit Deshpande](https://github.com/adeshpande3)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook accompanies [the O'Reilly interactive tutorial on generative adversarial networks](https://www.oreilly.com/learning/generative-adversarial-networks-for-beginners). See the original tutorial to run this code in a pre-built environment on O'Reilly's servers with cell-by-cell guidance, or run this notebook on your own machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, see [gan-script.py](gan-script.py) in this repository for a straight Python implementation of this code.\n",

    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/), [NumPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/install.html), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) in order to run this notebook on your machine. See [the readme](https://github.com/jonbruner/generative-adversarial-networks) for advice on installing these packages."

    "## GAN architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative adversarial networks consist of two models: a generative model and a discriminative model.\n",
    "\n",
    "![caption](notebook-images/GAN_Overall.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The discriminator model is a classifier that determines whether a given image looks like a real image from the dataset or like an artificially created image. This is basically a binary classifier that will take the form of a normal convolutional neural network (CNN).\n",
    "\n",
    "The generator model takes random input values and transforms them into images through a deconvolutional neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the course of many training iterations, the weights and biases in the discriminator and the generator are trained through backpropagation. The discriminator learns to tell \"real\" images of handwritten digits apart from \"fake\" images created by the generator. At the same time, the generator uses feedback from the discriminator to learn how to produce convincing images that the discriminator can't distinguish from real images."

We'll use [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), a benchmark dataset in deep learning. It consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits compiled by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology from Census Bureau employees and high school students.\n",
