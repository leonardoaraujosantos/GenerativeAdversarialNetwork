    "## Build a neural network that learns to generate handwritten digits.\n",
    "### By [Jon Bruner](https://github.com/jonbruner) and [Adit Deshpande](https://github.com/adeshpande3)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook accompanies [the O'Reilly interactive tutorial on generative adversarial networks](https://www.oreilly.com/learning/generative-adversarial-networks-for-beginners). See the original tutorial to run this code in a pre-built environment on O'Reilly's servers with cell-by-cell guidance, or run this notebook on your own machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, see [gan-script.py](gan-script.py) in this repository for a straight Python implementation of this code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/), [NumPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/install.html), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) in order to run this notebook on your machine. See [the readme](https://github.com/jonbruner/generative-adversarial-networks) for advice on installing these packages."

    "## GAN architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative adversarial networks consist of two models: a generative model and a discriminative model.\n",
    "\n",
    "![caption](notebook-images/GAN_Overall.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The discriminator model is a classifier that determines whether a given image looks like a real image from the dataset or like an artificially created image. This is basically a binary classifier that will take the form of a normal convolutional neural network (CNN).\n",
    "\n",
    "The generator model takes random input values and transforms them into images through a deconvolutional neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the course of many training iterations, the weights and biases in the discriminator and the generator are trained through backpropagation. The discriminator learns to tell \"real\" images of handwritten digits apart from \"fake\" images created by the generator. At the same time, the generator uses feedback from the discriminator to learn how to produce convincing images that the discriminator can't distinguish from real images."

    "## Loading MNIST data\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a set of real handwritten digits to give the discriminator a starting point in distinguishing between real and fake images. We'll use [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), a benchmark dataset in deep learning. It consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits compiled by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology from Census Bureau employees and high school students.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by importing TensorFlow along with a couple of other helpful libraries. We'll also import our MNIST images using a TensorFlow convenience function called `read_data_sets`."

    "Our discriminator is a convolutional neural network that takes in an image of size 28 x 28 x 1 as input and returns a single scalar number that describes whether or not the input image is \"real\" or \"fake\"—that is, whether it's drawn from the set of MNIST images or generated by the generator.\n",

    "The structure of our discriminator network is based closely on [TensorFlow's sample CNN classifier model](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/pros). It features two convolutional layers that find 5x5-pixel features, and two \"fully connected\" layers that multiply weights by every pixel in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "To set up each layer, we start by creating weight and bias variables through [`tf.get_variable`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/get_variable). Weights are initialized from a [truncated normal](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/truncated_normal) distribution, and biases are initialized at zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "[`tf.nn.conv2d()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/conv2d) is TensorFlow's standard convolution function. It takes 4 arguments. The first is the input volume (our `28 x 28 x 1` images in this case). The next argument is the filter/weight matrix. Finally, you can also change the stride and padding of the convolution. Those two values affect the dimensions of the output volume.\n",
